## To Run on Your iPhone with Expo Go

**Open a new Terminal and run:**

```bash
cd /Users/anusha/Documents/LinerNotes/apps/mobile
pnpm dev
```

**Wait for:**
- Metro Bundler to fully start (may take 1-2 minutes first time)
- QR code to appear in the terminal

**Then:**
1. Open **Expo Go** app on your iPhone
2. Tap **"Scan QR code"**
3. Point camera at the QR code in Terminal
4. App will load on your phone!

**If it hangs on "Waiting on http://localhost:8081":**
- Press Ctrl+C to stop
- Run: `rm -rf .expo && pnpm dev`
- Wait for Metro to rebuild cache (this is normal)

**For iOS Simulator (requires Xcode):**
```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
cd /Users/anusha/Documents/LinerNotes/apps/mobile
pnpm ios
```

## What You'll See

1. **Feed screen** with 4 mock reviews (TURMERIC, Blue Rev, SAW, Language)
2. **Tap a card** → hero expands to immersive Experience
3. **Tap + button** → Composer modal slides up
4. **Bottom tabs** → switch feed/profile
5. **Action buttons** → like/save/repost (with counts)
6. **Album reviews** → expandable track strips with reactions

## Next Steps

The app is ready to:
1. **Add real API integration** (replace mock data)
2. **Implement Composer** (create reviews)
3. **Implement Profile** (user's reviews + Top 4)
4. **Add Login** flow
5. **Implement Friend Requests** sidebar
6. **Add Instagram story export** (capture card at 1080x1920)
7. **Custom fonts** (load Newsreader, Hanken Grotesk, Space Mono, EB Garamond)

## Dependencies Added

- `react-native-svg` - For icons and reactions
- `expo-linear-gradient` - For gradients (already in package.json)
- `expo-sharing` + `react-native-view-shot` - For Instagram export (already in package.json)

## Notes

- **Fonts**: Currently using system fallbacks - load custom fonts for production
- **Hero animation**: Basic fade - can be enhanced with shared-element transitions
- **Timestamps**: Stored as integers, formatted to `m:ss` at display
- **Colors**: Album palette extraction stubbed (using mock palettes)
- **All design tokens** in `@linernotes/core` - shared with web
